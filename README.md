A simple word guessing game (complete with bugs!).

### Key Takeaways

- Game class with constructor forcing the caller to provide a name to guess
- `string` and `char` types. The string being a char array! ðŸ˜•
- Dictionary that accepts the generic types <int,char>
- KeyValuePair<int,char> object collection that resides in the Dictionary<int,char>

- If statements
- Console input, output
- While loop
  - `continue` to jump back to the start
  - `break` to exit the loop
